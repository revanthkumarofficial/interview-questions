thank you for this opportunity
hi myself is revanth kumar
I am a Software Engineer

Q. How will you contribute to our team?
"I will contribute to your team by being positive, by
getting to know my co-workers, by understanding what
I can do to help the team achieve its objectives based
on my strengths, and by analyzing what I can do to
support other people in the team.

I see it as my responsibility to fit into your team, to be
flexible and to do all I can to add value to what they are
already achieving."


Q. How do you prioritize tasks at work?
"I prioritize tasks at work by always listening to my manager's brief
carefully, by deciding which tasks are the most important in relation to
the team's objectives, and by determining the timescale for each task
to be completed.
For example, in my last role, I would focus on responding to all customer
queries as a priority because I knew how important this was to the success
of the business.
I would then concentrate on completing project and team tasks that
had a definitive timeframe for completion. Finally, I would work
through any general and non-urgent administrative tasks at the end of
each week so I could then commence work the following week wit
fresh start."


Q. What are your biggest strengths and weaknesses'
"The main strengths I possess that I believe will be beneficial in this role include
the fact that I always learn things quickly and I need very little supervision or
monitoring.
I can be relied upon to do everything to the right standard and on time. I am a creative
problem-solver which means I have the resilience and determination to overcome team
challenges in the best interests of your business.
I am a strong communicator and will always act as a positive role model for your
business. Finally, in respect of my strengths, I am somebody that will always take
responsibility for my own professional development, and I will embrace change
positively.
My weakness is the fact I struggle to ask other people for help if ever I am finding it
difficult to complete a task. I prefer to try and figure things out for myself when in fact I
should ask other people in the team for guidance.
Having said that, I am learning to be more mindful in situations such as these 9__
a.ways seek to improve and develop."

Q. How would you react if we told you a project youo
were halfway through completing had to be restarted?
"I would simply get on with my job and start the
project or task again.
Whatever the business needs me to do, I will do it. I
would, of course, ask my manager some questions to
determine what I needed to do differently this time,
but I would apply the same level of professionalism
and dedication once I started the project again."

Q. What's your ideal work environment?
"My ideal work environment is one that is positive,
busy and supportive.
I prefer to work in a diverse work environment where there
is a variety of skill and experience because this means you
can learn from the other people in your team.
It is very important to me to work in a progressive
environment where everyone is innovating, creating
and supporting their work colleagues to achieve the
businesses goals."

Q. How do you react to any mistakes that you makeT
"I would, first and foremost, be honest about the fact
that I had made a mistake.
Taking ownership of a mistake is important because it
enables you and others to learn from it, to put things right,
and to quickly move on.
I would not dwell on the mistake, but I'd be honest
about it, I would inform my manager if necessary, and I
would assess why I had made the mistake so I could
improve for next time."

Q. How do you handle conflicts with co-workers? o
"Where possible, I will try to avoid any form of conflict
because I don't believe it is helpful to the team.
However, if it did occur, I would be mature about it and adopt a
professional approach. I would see if I were contributing to the
conflict in any way and I would change my approach if needed.
I would speak to the person with who the conflict is with, try
to see things from their perspective, and agree on a way
forward we were both comfortable with.
We both may need to compromise to find a way forward that is in
the best interests of our team."

Q. Tell us about a time when you came up with an idea to improve ttb
workplace. What was the idea and how did you implement it?
"In a previous job, I was taking orders over the telephone from
customers.
The majority of the time, the customers were very happy with their
purchase. However, once they had placed their order over the phone, we
never had any further contact with the customers.
I decided to suggest to my manager that it would be a good idea to
register the customer's email address, with their permission, so we
could email them offers and discounts periodically.
We could also contact the customer to ask for feedback on their experience
after shopping with us, with a view to improving customer service standards
My manager felt this was a great idea and four weeks later we had a
system in place for capturing their contact details. This simple
